This project explores Document Embedding Vectors for Image Clustering and Reverse Image Search for Large scale document EDA.
It is applicable to Entreprise type documents which are largely text based, black and white multi-page documents.


This project extends the [BiT Colab Notebook](https://colab.research.google.com/github/google-research/big_transfer/blob/master/colabs/big_transfer_pytorch.ipynb)
to demonstrate how embeddings can be extracted from the model to be used for unsupervised learning. The note explores the Big Transfer model built by Google as explained in [Big Transfer (BiT): General Visual Representation Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/1912.11370).
